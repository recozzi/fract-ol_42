<h1>Fract-ol</h1>
The first graphical project at 42 school that explores the creation of visually stunning fractal images, leveraging the power of complex numbers within an iterative mathematical construct.
<h2>Overview</h2>
Fractals are fascinating and intricate patterns that exhibit self-similarity at various scales.
Students at 42 school delve into the world of complex numbers, used as input for an iterative algorithm, where each iteration calculates a new value based on the previous one.
By repeating this process, students can explore the behavior of the complex numbers within the algorithm and observe how the patterns evolve over time.
The project encourages students to experiment with different mathematical constructs, such as the Mandelbrot set or the Julia set, which are famous examples of fractals.
